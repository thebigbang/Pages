Custom Pages is a Windows .Net library made to help website developpers to manage .html content in their controller/view action.

Basically it's purpose is to offer a similer system than the one in WordPress, or any cmd offering the possibility to add pages to a website.
The main difference is that instead of using a database, it is using the filesystem, in a standalone way.
It can handle custom configuration information about pages.
